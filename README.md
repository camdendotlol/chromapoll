# Chromapoll ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦

Chromapoll is a fun polling platform where you can assign a color to each option.

As the votes come in, watch the colors mix together based on the number of votes for each choice.

Chromapoll employs basic protection with local storage and IP logging to prevent cheating.

## How to run

Make sure you have `yarn` installed and a MongoDB database ready for action.

First, use `yarn install` to install dependencies.

Then, set your env variables as listed in the Configuration section of this readme.

Now you can use `yarn start:full` to build and run Chromapoll in a single command.

Other commands:

* `yarn build` to create a production build of both the backend and frontend.
* `yarn start` to run the full production build after building.
* `yarn dev:server` for a development build that automatically reloads when you make a change.
* `yarn dev:ui` for a development build of the frontend.
* `yarn test:server` for some very rudimentary testing of the server API.

The `build` command also offers `:server` and `:ui` suffixes if you only need to build one of them, e.g. `yarn build:server`.

Builds are placed in the `/dist` directory, with `/dist/server` for the backend and `/dist/frontend` for the frontend.

## Configuration

Chromapoll looks for two env variables.

* PORT: the port on which the server will accept connections
* DB_URL: the URL to your MongoDB database

## Portfolio Reflection

The most prominent new technology that I learned for Chromapoll was WebSocket. Chromapoll uses web sockets to show changes in vote totals without having to refresh the page. I had to do some experimentation to get it to work on the same server as the API, but I ended up using the `ws` package to configure the socket in `/server/socket.ts`. Each time the client opens a poll, it opens a WebSocket connection and transmits the ID of the poll. The server then stores an object that keeps track of which poll the client is watching. When the server recieves a new vote for a poll, the vote path handler in `/server/controllers/poll.controller.ts` iterates through the array of WebSocket clients to broadcast the latest vote totals to anyone watching the newly updated poll. Meanwhile, the server runs a heartbeat function every 30 seconds to drop any disconnected clients.

On the frontend, this was my first time using `styled-components`, and I immediately found it pleasant to work with. One architectural mistake with [Groupread](https://github.com/mythmakerseven/groupread) that I recognized late in development was that it used a single sass file (along with importing the Bulma CSS file). It wasn't a big deal at the very beginning, but as the project grew it became bothersome to move between the sass file and the component code. I am still figuring out the best practices for styled-components so there might be some less-than-ideal component code, but it's already a much more efficient way to handle styling for each component.

This is the first project in which I've made an effort from the beginning to make re-usable components whenever possible. Some of my older projects have a few of them, but none of them started off with reusability as a priority and I started with them more recently. I keep these components in `/frontend/src/components/common`, but as with styled-components I am still learning the best way to write them. I'm particularly satisfied with the `Button` component, which includes some nice styling and accepts a label and a callback function as props.

One small thing I want to mention is the `/frontend/src/breakpoints.ts` file, which contains CSS breakpoints for the whole site. Any time I use a breakpoint in a styled component, I import the breakpoint object and use a ${string template} to specify which one (e.g. `breakpoints.phone`). I came up with this for two reasons: 1) I can update the breakpoints in one place if I change my mind about what they're set at, and 2) I don't have to remember the specific pixel amount every time I write a media query. There are only two breakpoints right now, but I can expand it in the future whenever I need to and it'll keep track of all my breakpoints for me.
