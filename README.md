## How to run

Make sure you have `yarn` installed and a MongoDB database ready for action.

First, use `yarn install` to install dependencies.

Commands:

* `yarn start` to create a fresh build and run it.
* `yarn dev` for a development build that automatically reloads when you make a change.

## Configuration

Chromapoll looks for two env variables.

* PORT: the port on which the server will accept connections
* DB_URL: the URL to your MongoDB database
