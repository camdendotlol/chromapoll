# Chromapoll ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦

Super secret project ðŸ˜Œ

More details will come soon!

## How to run

Make sure you have `yarn` installed and a MongoDB database ready for action.

First, use `yarn install` to install dependencies.

Commands:

* `yarn start:server` to create a fresh build and run it.
* `yarn dev:server` for a development build that automatically reloads when you make a change.
* `yarn test:server` for some very rudimentary testing of the server API.

## Configuration

Chromapoll looks for two env variables.

* PORT: the port on which the server will accept connections
* DB_URL: the URL to your MongoDB database
